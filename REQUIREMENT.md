Project Overview: Memory Story Vault
One-Sentence Summary
A mobile app that automatically backs up photos for elderly users, adds meaningful context, and turns each image into a short storytelling moment — helping families relive memories together.
Main Value Proposition
Help grandparents easily preserve and share their memories through photos and voice stories — transforming every image into a story their family can hear, respond to, and treasure for generations.
Why It Matters
Emotional: Strengthens family bonds by sparking intergenerational conversations.
Convenience: Automatically backs up photos and adds context (time, location, notes) — reducing clutter and confusion.
Long-Term Value: Keeps meaningful memories alive — not just raw photo files — making it more valuable than ordinary cloud storage.
Simple MVP Metric
Engagement ratio:
Number of “photos with stories recorded or reacted to” ÷ total shared photos in the first week.
Target: >30%
Next Steps (1 Week MVP)


Build a mobile prototype with:


Automatic photo backup


“Tell Story” button (voice recording up to 60s)




Invite 5 families (grandparent + paying family member) to test.


Measure:


Which photos they choose to tell stories about


How children/grandchildren react after listening





Core Features Overview
1. Family Onboarding


Shared “Family Account” with two roles:


Elder user (grandparent)


Family admin (child, who pays/subscribes)




Simple phone number signup and invite link via Zalo/OTP.


MVP: 1-tap join from invitation link.


Risk: Sign-up friction → mitigate with direct invite flow.


2. Automatic Photo Backup


Auto-uploads photos from the elder’s device when on Wi-Fi or charging.


Keeps original + thumbnail versions.


MVP: Upload queue that syncs when Wi-Fi is available.


Risk: Data/storage cost → start with 5 GB free limit.


3. Organize & Add Context


Create albums and tags (manual or AI-generated).


Auto-detect date, location, event type (e.g. “Tết”, “Cafe”, “Trip”).


MVP: Simple album view + auto date/location tagging.


Risk: Wrong auto-tag → allow manual edit.


4. Storytelling Prompts


AI or template-based prompts help grandparents recall memories.


Example: “What were you doing in this picture, Grandma?”


MVP: Predefined prompt templates.


5. Voice Story Recording


One-tap “Tell Story” button — record up to 60 seconds audio.


Save and attach voice clip to photo, with optional transcript.


MVP: Audio upload + simple player.


6. Family Feed & Reactions


Central feed showing photos and voice stories.


Family members can like, comment (text/voice), or send stickers.


Push or Zalo notifications for new stories.


MVP: Feed + simple interaction system.


7. Reminders & Memories


Gentle reminders to tell stories about old photos.


Notifications for “On this day” or “Unshared photos.”


MVP: Weekly reminder system.


8. Privacy & Sharing


Control visibility: Private / Family / Public.


Option to export photos + audio as printable albums (PDF/CSV).


MVP: Simple visibility toggle.


9. Accessibility & Elder-Friendly UI


Large fonts, big buttons, voice labels, high contrast.


Optional voice control for play/record actions.


MVP: Large typography and accessible layout.


10. Monetization & Storage Management


Family subscription model for extra storage.


Optional printed photobook feature.


MVP: Subscription + storage tracker.



Design Philosophy
