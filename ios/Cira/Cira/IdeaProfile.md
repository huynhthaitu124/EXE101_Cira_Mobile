1. Problem (~2 minutes) — Simplified Script
“Good afternoon, everyone.
Let me start with a moment we all know:
 It’s late at night, and you’re scrolling through hundreds of old photos—your kid’s first steps, family trips, your grandmother’s smile at dinner.
 You took those photos to remember the joy… but now they’re buried somewhere in your phone, collecting digital dust.
For busy families—especially older members—this hits hard.
 We take thousands of photos every year.
 But about 70% of them are never seen again after six months.
 Not because we don’t care—
 but because life gets busy, and without the stories behind them, those pictures lose their meaning.
That beach photo?
 It could remind you of your child’s sandy masterpiece… or your dad’s silly jokes.
 But instead, it becomes just another forgotten image.
And as time goes by—kids grow up, loved ones aged—we risk losing the memories that make our family who we are.
The tools we use today don’t solve this.
 – Google Photos and iCloud store photos, but feel cold and impersonal.
 – Scrapbook tools like Shutterfly take way too much time.
 – Social media is fast, but everything fades or feels too public.
Families need something simple and warm—
 A way to keep memories alive, not lost in a photo library.
That’s the problem CIRA was made to fix.”

2. Solution (~2 minutes) — Simplified Script
“CIRA is a simple mobile app that turns your messy photo collection into living family stories — so you never lose the moments again.
Here’s how it works:
Upload a photo.
 Add a quick voice note like,
 ‘Remember Uncle dancing at the party?’
 And CIRA’s AI instantly turns it into a short, meaningful story in your family feed.
No editing.
 No searching.
 Just tap, speak, and save the moment.
CIRA also sends gentle memory prompts—like a weekly reel—so your family can relive old laughs, special holidays, and little moments you forgot.
 Families using CIRA talk more—share more—
 and reconnect without effort.

4. User Proof
(0 – 15 seconds: Validating the Timeless Storytelling Need)
"We are not relying on assumptions. The profound need for a Memory Storytelling and Legacy preservation platform has been powerfully validated in international markets. It’s a timeless human emotional need: to be heard and to preserve one’s life narrative."
(15 – 35 seconds: Evidence from Leading Storytelling Companies)
"Look at the leaders in this space: StoryWorth has successfully sold over 1 million memory books, proving that families are willing to pay significant amounts to turn life stories into a tangible keepsake. Similarly, Remento has acquired tens of thousands of users simply by providing prompts to record personal narratives."
(35 – 50 seconds: Highlighting the Critical Gap)
"However, both apps have critical flaws for the Vietnamese market: They rely heavily on manual interaction (typing, writing) and use interfaces unfriendly to older adults. Crucially, they neglect the power of photos—the single largest memory archive in every family."
(50 – 60 seconds: Closing with CIRA’s Superior Approach)
"But their success confirms that the storytelling market exists. CIRA simply offers a superior approach—leveraging voice, photos, and radical simplicity—to capture this massive, underserved demand in Vietnam."


5. Opportunity – Market & Revenue
“Now I’ll talk about the opportunity for CIRA.
Vietnam today has around 18 to 19 million aged 35 to 55 who are online, use smartphones and e-wallets. That’s our TAM – everyone who could buy a digital gift for their parents.
From that, we narrow down to the people who are both digitally ready and emotionally motivated to spend on family connection and memories. We estimate about 5 to 6 million adults – that’s our SAM, the Serviceable Available Market.
In year one we are not trying to boil the ocean. We aim to reach just 20,000 people in this group and convert about 3,600 of them into paying families. That is our SOM – the realistic, obtainable market for year one.
With our current pricing – 79 thousands for Personal, 179 thousands for Family and 499 thousands for Premium – the average paying family brings about 150,000 VND per month, or roughly 1.8 million VND per year.
So if we hit 3,600 paying families, our first-year subscription revenue is around 6.5 billion VND, or roughly a quarter of a million US dollars, with strong upside as we scale beyond the first 1% of the market.”

6. Sales Playbook – How We Win Customers
“How do we get those customers?
First, we go gift-first on social: TikTok, Facebook and Zalo ads built around one idea – ‘a digital home where your parents can relive their memories and hear your love every day’. Every ad pushes to a 1-minute demo: upload a few photos, hear an AI voice tell your parent’s story.
Second, we work with senior clubs, community groups and companies. We position CIRA as a family-care benefit so employees can buy or receive CIRA for their parents.
Third, we plug into e-wallet and telco bundles, where our users already pay their monthly services.
With this playbook, our target customer acquisition cost is under one month of revenue per family, and our lifetime value is at least eight times the CAC.”
